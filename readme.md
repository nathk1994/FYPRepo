# Student Lab Manager

## Description

The resourceâ€™s architecture was developed using multiple technologies such as the Angular framework, TypeScript, Node.js and MySQL.
The resource was successfully web-hosted via the A2 Hosting service and was always available and very accessible. 
The functionality is driven by 'lecturers' and 'students' working together to create their own flexible 'class lab schedules' if desired.

- Front-End UI created with Angular 12.
- Bootstrap is used to ensure mobile devices can access the application without UI difficulties.
- The application makes use of the JavaScript Web Token for request authtentication.
- Node.js for high-performing and compact back-end server in combination with a MySQL database.
- Users are granted access to register with the application, only if they hold a valid college email address.
- 'Lecturers' are 'notified' via email, that a 'student' has 'reserved a slot' in a 'Class Lab Group'.

These are technologies that I have worked with in the past during a previous software engineering internship and education. Working with these technologies was both fun and challenging and allowed me to continously learn. 
My general programming, Angular/TypeScript & DevOps knowledge grew (specificlally Apache web server, while attempting AWS and Docker deployments) as I successfully overcame the challenges and blockers that came with deploying a full-stack application on the internet.
